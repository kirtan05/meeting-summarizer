"Here is a structured summary of the discussion:

**Discussion Points/Agenda:**
The main topic discussed during the meeting was the authorization of an ordinance to allow the city manager to execute a 15-year lease with Nautilus Data Technologies for a data center at Alameda Point. The lease includes a five-year option to extend. The data center would use a once-through cooling system, drawing water from the bay, using it to cool the data center, and then discharging the warmer water back into the bay.

**Decisions Made:**
The council voted to reject the staff recommendation to approve the lease, effectively denying the project. The vote was unanimous, with all council members voting against the project.

**Action Items:**
- None explicitly stated as a result of the decision made.

The discussion included concerns about the potential environmental impacts of the project, particularly on the harbor seals, fish, and other marine life in the bay. Many speakers, including representatives from environmental groups and concerned citizens, expressed opposition to the project. Key concerns included:

- The use of an outdated once-through cooling system that would discharge warm water into the bay.
- Potential harm to marine life, including harbor seals, least terns, and fish.
- The possibility of toxic algae blooms and decreased oxygen levels in the water.
- The project's inconsistency with the state's phase-out of once-through cooling systems by 2024.

Supporters of the project highlighted its potential economic benefits, including $20 to $25 million in annual revenue for Alameda Municipal Power (AMP) and the creation of jobs. However, opponents argued that these benefits did not outweigh the potential environmental costs.

The council ultimately decided that the potential risks to the environment and the bay's ecosystem outweighed the benefits of the project, leading to their decision to reject the lease."
