Please read Target 0645. Don't you love me? You really love me. Doug Number 0645 Councilor Murphy offer the following resolution recognizing the contributions of African-American military veterans and recognize African-American military Heritage Month. Thank you, Mr. Clarke. The chair recognizes. Counsel Murphy. Counsel Murphy, you have the floor. Thank you. I'd like to suspend the rules and add Counselor Anderson and President Flynn, please. Seeing no objection. Council Fernandez Enerson in the chair also ordered. Thank you, Counselor Murphy. So thank you. So I want to thank Commissioner Santiago from Boston Veterans Services and Mr. Finnell, who are here in the audience. And thank you, Mr. Finnell, for your sacrifice and commitment and service during the Vietnam War and in Okinawa. And thank you also for your continued community service in your educational endeavors as a poet and founder of the Oscar Micheaux Family Theater program. So thank you for that. And I stand to offer this resolution today to recognize Saturday, May 21st, 2022, as African-American Military Heritage Day. Each year at the General Edward O. Gordon Veterans Memorial Park, the Organization of Afro-American Veterans and other military veteran organizations gather to memorialize the history and contributions of African-American military veterans. Here they honor African-American military and civil service by conversating with one another and sharing their experiences. In general, 43% of the 1.3 million men and women on active duty in the United States military are people of color. Yet only two of the 41 most senior commanders in the military are black. Most, more specifically, in 2020, black soldiers compromised approximately 21% of active duty army, 15% of the Army National Guard, and 21% of the Army Reserve. It should be noted that black Americans serve in the Army at a higher rate than their representation rate in the U.S. population, which is 13.4. So the purpose of annually celebrating African military Heritage Day in Boston is to recognize and commemorate the service of African American veterans in every war. The history will not be forgotten, and I'm happy to say that Veterans Memorial Park in Roxbury plays a part in this commemoration. With that said, Boston will continue to support the United States African-American military and veterans to show that our city strongly embraces diversity, to create a system that maximizes individual talents and increases morale regardless of race , color or gender. So in short, I ask that my colleagues on the Boston Council pass this resolution to acknowledge Saturday, May 21st, 2022, as African American Military Heritage Day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Councilor Murphy, the chair recognizes Councilor Fernandez Anderson. Counsel Fernandez Anderson. You have the floor. Thank you. Councilor Flynn. Council President Flynn. Thank you, Councilor Murphy, for offering this resolution to recognize the African-American military veterans who have served in the U.S. armed forces throughout this nation's history. They have served despite often being the victims of blatant racism and discrimination. During civil war, they fought to help free their enslaved brethren and themselves during World War II, and they served bravely only to come back to this country to be lynched and beaten, often in uniform immediately after the war. During World War Two, they fought courageously to defeat fascism while continuing to be victimized by Jim Crow and legalized segregation at home. The army itself was not segregated until 1950, meaning that in all the wars I've described above, the black soldiers were in separate fighting units, often led by segregationist commanders. During the Vietnam War, while black people were rising up for their freedom in this country. Many others were drafted into or chose to serve in the army. They fought bravely, even if they weren't always in full agreement with the objectives or if their main goals was to come home in one piece. And so it goes. So the present day where black men and women continue to serve our country via their service in the military. One of them being my son. Luis Miguel. Let me just say, Luis Miguel, Freddy Rocha, who is a marine who I am extremely proud of, who? Induces anxiety every time I talk with him because he is so dear and dear to my heart, I'm extremely proud of him. This young man is so beautiful in and out. Not because I'm his mother, obviously, but I am so extremely proud of my son for making his own decision, for being someone who wants to serve his country. And I am just I can't say how how happy I am that he has taken his own path to serve our country and how much I love him for it. And I pray for his protection and guidance. Guidance always. Amen. So thanks again to my colleagues and for offering us a solution and I am gladly to the second. Thank you. Thank you. Councilor Fernandez Anderson. I would like to echo. The comments of Councilor Fernandez innocent and Councilor Murphy. Exceptional heroism of African-American men and women in their role. Is part of the US military. They fought bravely. They fought under very difficult conditions. They came back to the States and weren't treated with the respect and dignity that they've earned. I've had a good friend Will assigned, as well as Saunders, who's passed away. It's an older gentleman. He was a Tuskegee Airman, superintendent of the Boston Police. And I heard him tell stories about the incredible sacrifices and contributions of African-American men and women in the military to our country. So I just want to say thank you to my colleagues, but the entire body for for supporting African-American veterans. I'd also like to. Thank my friend who's the Commissioner of Veterans Services, Rob Santiago, for always being there in support of African-American veterans and making sure that they have the services and programs that they've earned. So thank you, Commissioner Santiago. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter, or would anyone else like the chair recognize this Council of Borough Council? Laura, you have the floor. Thank you. President Flynn. I just wanted to rise to extend my. Gratitude and thanks to the veterans that are here with us today. I think it's incredibly honorable to fight for your country when so many times we have failed to fight for them in the same way. I am excited to support this resolution in honor of black veterans, in honor of the Black Veteran War tax resisters, in honor of the Black Veteran Vietnam War veterans and the people, the black veterans who fought against the war here and abroad.
