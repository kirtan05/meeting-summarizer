"## Meeting Summary

### Discussion Points/Agenda

The meeting discussed Council Bill 2022-0016, which proposed a rezoning of two properties at 1974 and 1990 South Huron Street from E2 to ESU. The rezoning aimed to allow for the development of three single-family homes on each lot, rather than the current zoning which allows for duplexes.

### Decisions Made

The council voted on the bill, and it failed with 5 yes votes and 8 no votes.

### Action Items

- The rezoning application was not approved.
- The city council will continue to consider other rezoning applications and neighborhood plans.

## Detailed Discussion

The discussion centered around the proposed rezoning of two properties in the Overland neighborhood. The applicant, Neil Shay, presented a plan to develop three single-family homes on each of the two lots, which would be a change from the current zoning that allows for duplexes. The applicant argued that this would provide more affordable housing options and maintain the character of the neighborhood.

Several council members expressed concerns about the consistency of the rezoning with adopted plans, particularly Blueprint Denver and the Seven Station Area Plan. They also discussed the potential impact on density, traffic, and parking in the area.

Council members Clark, Flynn, and Sawyer voted no, citing concerns about consistency with adopted plans and the potential for increased density. Council members Herndon, Black, and President Gilmore voted yes, supporting the creative solution and the need for more affordable housing options.

The planning board had previously voted 8-1 in favor of the rezoning, and the Overland Park Neighborhood Association also supported the proposal. However, many residents spoke out against the rezoning, citing concerns about increased density, traffic, and parking.

## Conclusion

The failure of Council Bill 2022-0016 means that the current zoning for the properties at 1974 and 1990 South Huron Street will remain in effect, allowing for the development of duplexes. The city council will continue to consider other rezoning applications and neighborhood plans to address the need for affordable housing and manage growth in the city."
